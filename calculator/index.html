              <h2>About the Calculator</h2>
              
              <p>
                This <strong>free</strong> 4WD GVM calculator helps Australian drivers accurately estimate <strong>remaining payload, axle loads, and vehicle weight</strong> using real-world vehicle geometry and brand-specific accessories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike generic calculators, this tool accounts for <strong>vehicle-specific mounting positions</strong>   and <strong>real accessory weights</strong>, so you’re not guessing or relying on rough averages.
              </p>

              <p>
                It’s ideal for popular platforms such as the
                <strong>Toyota LandCruiser 200 Series</strong>,
                <strong>79 Series</strong>,
                <strong>Y62 Patrol</strong>,
                <strong>Prado</strong>, and other touring 4WDs.
              </p>

              <h3>How this calculator is different</h3>

              <p>
                Most online GVM calculators use generic weight assumptions.
                This calculator goes further by modelling <strong>real-world vehicle geometry</strong>
                and <strong>brand-specific accessories</strong>.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Vehicle-Specific Load Positions:</strong>
                  Each vehicle model uses realistic axle distances and mounting points,
                  so weight placement reflects how your vehicle actually behaves.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Brand & Model Accessories:</strong>
                  Accessories are based on real products - meaning you don’t need to guess weights
                  or search manufacturer specs.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Realistic Load Transfer:</strong>
                  See how accessories affect both total GVM and front/rear axle loads.
                </li>

      <h2>Built Using Real Vehicle Geometry</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike basic calculators, this tool uses vehicle-specific axle positions and mounting locations
        to accurately model how weight is distributed across your 4WD.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Accessory weights are based on real brand and model data - helping you plan your setup
        without relying on guesswork or rough estimates.
      </p>

      <h2>Why staying under GVM matters</h2>

      <p>
        Exceeding your GVM doesn’t just affect legality - it directly impacts safety,
        handling, and long-term reliability.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safety & Handling:</strong> Correct weight distribution improves braking, stability, and steering.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance Compliance:</strong> Overloaded vehicles may void insurance coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Component Longevity:</strong> Reduces stress on suspension, chassis, bearings, and tyres.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Who Should Use a 4WD GVM Calculator?</h2>
      <p>
      This tool is ideal for touring setups, tradespeople, off-road builds, and anyone fitting accessories such as bull bars, canopies, drawers, roof racks, or towing caravans and trailers.

          <summary>Do I need to estimate accessory weights?</summary>
          <p>No. Accessories are selected by brand and model so users don’t need to guess weights or research specifications separately. It is recommended to verify weights with manufacturers specifications before committing to a purchase.

    <h2>Vehicle Weight Glossary</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Tare Mass</dt>
      <dd>The weight of the vehicle with 10L of fuel and all fluids, but <em>zero</em> passengers or cargo. This is often the "showroom" weight.</dd>

      <dt>Kerb Weight</dt>
      <dd>The vehicle ready to drive with a full tank of fuel, but no passengers or payload. (Check your manual, definitions vary by manufacturer).</dd>
      
      <dt>Axle Capacity</dt>
      <dd>The maximum weight a single axle (front or rear) can carry. The sum of Front + Rear Axle limits is usually <em>higher</em> than the total GVM.</dd>

<div class="faq-item">
        <details>
          <summary>What is the difference between GVM and Payload?</summary>
          <p><strong>GVM (Gross Vehicle Mass)</strong> is the maximum legal weight of your vehicle when fully loaded. <strong>Payload</strong> is the weight you can add to the vehicle (passengers, accessories, fuel, and cargo). Put simply: <em>Curb Weight + Payload = GVM</em>. This calculator helps you see if your payload exceeds the GVM limit.</p>
        </details>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <details>
          <summary>Does tow ball weight count towards my GVM?</summary>
          <p><strong>Yes, absolutely.</strong> The downward weight of your caravan or trailer on the tow ball (Tow Ball Mass) is considered as vehicle "payload" and acts as a heavy weight on your rear axle. While this tool does not calculate GCM (total combination weight), you can add your tow ball weight as an accessory to see how it affects your GVM and rear axle load.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <details>
          <summary>Does a suspension upgrade automatically increase my GVM?</summary>
          <p>No. Installing heavier springs or shocks improves load-carrying ability and reduces sag, but it does <strong>not</strong> legally change your GVM. To legally carry more weight, you must have a certified <strong>GVM Upgrade</strong> plate fitted by an approved engineer. This calculator is perfect for determining if you need to pursue a GVM upgrade.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <details>
          <summary>Why is Rear Axle Load important?</summary>
          <p>Many 4WDs exceed their <strong>Rear Axle Capacity</strong> before they hit their total GVM limit. This happens due to the "cantilever effect" of heavy items behind the rear wheels (like drawers, fridges, spare wheel carriers, and tow ball weight). This tool calculates that leverage to warn you if your rear axle is overloaded.</p>
