                <h2>The Problem</h2>
            
                <p>
                The Project GVM 200 Series required a rooftop tent. The common approach for the 200 Series is a backbone-style continuous rail system supporting either a roof platform or load bars.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                One of our primary goals, however, was quick and easy removal of the rooftop tent. We wanted the roof to remain clean and low-profile for long-distance touring without camping gear, and for more technical 4WD trips where reduced weight and height matter.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                  The main options we considered were:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Backbone with platform:</strong> Excellent roof rating, but we didn’t like the additional platform weight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backbone with load bars:</strong> Strong and proven, but visually intrusive once the tent is removed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rhino-Rack RCP roof mount kit:</strong> Adequate roof rating (150kg) and a minimal footprint when removed, which suited our goals.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  The limitation of the RCP roof mount kit is that it utilises only six of the eight available roof mounting points. We also weren’t comfortable with the front overhang created by this configuration.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                  While the kit largely ticked our boxes, as with our <a href="/calculator/" class="no-style-link">free GVM calculator</a>, we don’t hesitate to refine and improve where possible.
                </p>

                  Further research revealed very little information, until we found an older reference to a Rhino-Rack kit that included two sets of the rear mounts. This configuration also appeared in a now discontinued package from a roof rack supplier.
                </p>

                  Using the three rear mounts installed and checking alignment with a straight edge, we confirmed that a rear mount fitted in the forward position maintains the correct angle. However, it sits approximately 5mm lower than the other mounts.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                  Rhino-Rack supply off-the-shelf spacers up to 20mm, so correcting the 5mm height difference was straightforward. All additional components required to achieve this setup are shown below.

                <p>
                  The official Rhino-Rack roof rating of 150kg is not formally increased with this configuration. However, the load distribution across eight mounting points provides improved support and reduces perceived stress on the vehicle.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                  Rhino-Rack’s standard leg option for the 200 Series is the RCH leg (52mm height). As the Project GVM 200 Series does not have a roof-mounted aerial, we opted for the RCL legs at 37mm height which is 15mm lower. Again this doesn't formally change the roof rating, but a lower load will have less force on the roof and mounts but from dynamics and aerodynamics.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                  This results in a lower profile than a backbone system (with the same load bars) and remains compatible with Pioneer platforms if required.
                </p>
