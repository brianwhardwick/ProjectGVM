                    Welcome to Project GVM (the "Site"). By accessing or using our website and the GVM calculator tools contained within,
                    you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms").

                <p>
                    The GVM Calculator provided on this Site is designed for educational and illustrative purposes only.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not a substitute for weighing:</strong> Results are estimates and must not be treated as accurate measurements of your vehicle’s actual weight. The only way to obtain an accurate vehicle weight is to use a certified public weighbridge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not professional advice:</strong> This Site does not provide engineering, legal, compliance, safety, or other professional advice. Using this tool does not create a professional relationship between you and Project GVM.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic loading not included:</strong> The calculator does not account for dynamic loads, off-road conditions, braking forces, or real-world weight transfer.</li>
                </ul>
