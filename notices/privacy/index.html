                    This Privacy Policy explains how Project GVM (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, stores, and discloses personal information 
                    when you use https://www.projectgvm.com.au (“the Website”).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) 
                    and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).
                </p>

                <h3>1. Anonymity and Use of the Website</h3>
                <p>
                    You may use the GVM calculator anonymously. We do not require you to provide personal identifying 
                    information to access or use the calculator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We only collect personal information (such as your name or email address) if you choose to 
                    contact us or voluntarily submit information.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>

                <p>
                    Calculator interaction logs are generally recorded after short periods of inactivity 
                    and are associated with a session identifier. These logs are not directly linked 
                    to your name unless you separately provide identifying information.

                    Some third-party service providers may store or process data outside Australia. 
                    Where practicable, these providers are located in jurisdictions such as the United States.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We take reasonable steps to ensure overseas recipients handle personal information

                </p>

                <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>

                <p>
                    We retain personal and usage information only for as long as reasonably necessary 
                    to provide and improve the Website, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes 
                    and enforce agreements.
                </p>
