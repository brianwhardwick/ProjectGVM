                <p>
                    The information provided on https://www.projectgvm.com.au, including all outputs generated by the Project GVM calculator (“Calculator”),
                    is provided for general information and planning purposes only. This Disclaimer forms part of the Terms &amp; Conditions of use.
                </p>

                <h3>1. General Information Only</h3>
                               
                <p>The Calculator and all associated content:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide indicative estimates only</li>
                    <li>Are based on user-supplied inputs, published specifications, and general assumptions</li>
                    <li>Do not constitute engineering, legal, compliance, safety, financial, or other professional advice</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The Calculator does not measure actual vehicle weight and does not replace physical weighing, certified weighbridge measurements,
                    engineering certification, regulatory approvals, or independent compliance assessment.
                </p>

                <p>Vehicle weights, load distribution, modification approvals, and compliance outcomes may vary depending on (including, but not limited to):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicle make, model, year, and variant</li>
                    <li>Specific modifications and their installation quality</li>
                    <li>Load placement and distribution (including dynamic loads)</li>
                    <li>State and territory regulations and interpretations</li>
                    <li>Individual certifying engineer or authority requirements</li>
                    <li>Fluid levels, manufacturing tolerances, tyre selection, and operating conditions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    No professional-client, engineer-client, or advisory relationship is created by your use of this Website or the Calculator.
                </p>

                <h3>2. No Guarantee of Compliance</h3>
                               
                <p>Use of this Website or Calculator does not guarantee:</p>   
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicle legality or roadworthiness</li>
                    <li>Compliance with GVM, GCM, axle limits, towball mass limits, or any other ratings, rules, or standards</li>
                    <li>Approval by an engineer, insurer, manufacturer, or regulatory authority</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You must always verify your vehicle’s actual weight at a certified public weighbridge and consult a qualified automotive engineer
                    or relevant authority before modifying or operating your vehicle.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Accuracy of Information</h3>
                               
                <p>While reasonable efforts are made to maintain accurate and up-to-date information:</p>   
                <ul>
                    <li>No warranties or representations are made regarding accuracy, completeness, currency, or reliability</li>
                    <li>Results may be affected by incorrect, incomplete, outdated, or unavailable data</li>
                    <li>Real-world conditions, manufacturing tolerances, and dynamic loads are not fully captured</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Use of the Website and Calculator is entirely at your own risk.</p>

                <h3>4. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                               
                <p>
                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Project GVM is not liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense (including indirect,
                    incidental, special, or consequential loss) arising from or in connection with:
                </p>   
                <ul>
                    <li>Your access to, use of, or reliance on the Website or Calculator</li>
                    <li>Decisions made based on calculated results</li>
                    <li>Vehicle modifications, loading, towing, or operation</li>
                    <li>Any errors, omissions, interruptions, delays, or data inaccuracies</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Nothing in this Disclaimer excludes, restricts, or modifies any rights or remedies that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law
                    or other applicable legislation.
                </p>

                <h3>5. External Links, Third-Party Content, and Sponsored/Suggested Items</h3>
                               
                <p>
                    This Website may contain links to third-party websites, products, suppliers, or services. Project GVM does not control and is not responsible
                    for the content, accuracy, availability, security, or practices of third-party sites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Calculator and Website may also display certain items as “Suggested” or “Sponsored” (for example, where a supplier provides a link,
                    promotion, or prioritised listing). Where this occurs, Project GVM aims to label these items in the user interface. Any such display does not
                    remove your responsibility to verify suitability, legality, compliance, pricing, availability, and claims directly with the third party.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inclusion of brands, products, accessories, suppliers, or links within the Calculator or Website does not constitute endorsement,
                    recommendation, sponsorship, or approval by Project GVM unless expressly stated.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Acceptance</h3>
