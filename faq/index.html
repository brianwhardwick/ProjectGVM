                        <p>GVM stands for Gross Vehicle Mass. It is the maximum legal weight your vehicle can weigh when fully loaded. This includes the vehicle itself, fuel, all accessories (bullbars, winches), passengers, and cargo. Exceeding your GVM is illegal, can void your insurance, and makes your vehicle unsafe to drive.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tare Weight</strong> is the weight of the empty vehicle with 10 litres of fuel and no occupants.<br><br>

                        <p>Generally, no. In many cases, it actually reduces it. Most vehicles have a Gross Combination Mass (GCM), which is the total allowed weight of the vehicle plus the trailer.

                        <p>Weight placed behind the rear axle (like a heavy tow ball weight, spare wheels, or jerry cans) acts like a lever. It pushes the rear down but actually lifts weight off the front wheels. This creates a pivot point that multiplies the load on the rear axle. This calculator automatically calculates this weight transfer for you.</p>

                        <p>GVM is the total weight limit of the car. However, your vehicle also has a Front Axle Limit and a Rear Axle Limit. It is possible to be under your total GVM but still exceed the rear axle limit if you pack too much weight in the back. This calculator checks both your total GVM and individual axle loads.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>How accurate is this calculator?</summary>
                        <p><a href="https://calculator.projectgvm.com.au/">The calculator</a> provides a highly educated estimate based on manufacturer specifications and average accessory weights. However, every vehicle is unique due to manufacturing tolerances and specific accessory choices. This tool is for planning purposes; for 100% compliance, you must weigh your vehicle at a certified weighbridge.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Why did my Front Axle weight decrease when I added a load to the boot?</summary>
                        <p>This is due to the physics of the wheelbase. When you add weight behind the rear wheels (the "overhang"), it acts as a lever, putting more pressure on the rear axle and lifting weight off the front axle. This is critical for steering and braking safety. Read our full guide on <a href="/learn/towing-safely">Safe Towing & Weight Distribution</a>.</p>

                        <summary>Why is the calculator showing a red warning for my Rear Axle?</summary>
                        <p>You may be under your total GVM limit, but you have exceeded the load capacity for the rear axle. This is common in dual-cab utes. You can try moving heavy items forward (between the axles), removing accessories, or investigating a suspension upgrade that increases axle capacity.</p>

                        <p>Yes. By default, <a href="https://calculator.projectgvm.com.au/">the calculator</a> adds 85kg for the driver. You can adjust this in the "Occupants" section to "Driver Only" or specific passenger configurations to get a more accurate result.</p>

                        <p>If you fit a GVM upgrade after the vehicle has already been registered (Post-Rego), it requires an engineering signatory (compliance plate) relevant to your state. A federally approved upgrade (SSM) usually applies to brand-new vehicles prior to first registration. Always check with your local transport authority.</p>
