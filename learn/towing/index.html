          Hitching 3 tonnes of caravan or camper trailer to your vehicle changes everything. It changes how you steer, how you stop, and how you react in an emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
          While our <a href="/calculator/" class="no-style-link">calculator</a> helps you get the weights legal, staying safe on the road requires a different set of skills. Whether you’re towing a box trailer to the tip or a 24ft caravan around Australia, these principles will keep your rig upright and your family safe.

        <h2>Towing Stability Fundamentals</h2>

        <h3>1. The 10% Rule (The Lever Effect)</h3>
        <p>The single biggest cause of trailer instability is poor weight distribution. It isn’t just about GVM; it is about where the <strong>Centre of Gravity (COG)</strong> sits.</p>

        <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> You generally want 10% of the loaded trailer’s weight resting on the tow ball. This helps keep the mass forward of the axles.</p>

        <div class="article-image full-width">
          <figure>
            <img src="/assets/img/content/caravan-forward-cog.jpg"
                 alt="Diagram showing stable towing with centre of gravity forward of axles"
                 class="diagram-img"
                 loading="lazy">
            <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #666; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;">
              <strong>Fig 1. Correct Setup:</strong> With mass forward of the axles, the centrifugal force helps the car turn safely.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="/assets/img/content/caravan-rear-cog.jpg"
                 alt="Diagram showing unstable towing with centre of gravity rear of axles"
                 class="diagram-img"
                 loading="lazy">
            <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #666; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;">
              <strong>Fig 2. Dangerous Setup:</strong> This configuration often appears acceptable until calculated properly.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>As shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, if you load too much weight at the back (behind the axles), the caravan becomes a lever. When you turn into a corner, the momentum of that rear weight pivots on the axle and pushes the tow ball in the <em>opposite</em> direction.</p>

        <p>This creates a “pendulum” effect. The caravan actively fights the tow vehicle, straightening the car out against the driver’s steering input. This is a primary cause of unexpected understeer and jackknifing.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Tow ball download counts as payload on your vehicle and reduces available GVM and rear axle capacity. Use the <a href="/calculator/" class="text-link">Project GVM Calculator</a> to check your setup.
        </p>

        <h3>2. The Hill Trap (Static vs. Dynamic Weight)</h3>

        <p>After seeing the pendulum effect above, you might ask: <strong>Why don’t we just put the weight directly over the axles?</strong></p>

        <p>It seems like the perfect solution—perfect balance means no lever effect, right? While that works on a flat driveway, the game changes completely when you hit a hill.</p>

        <figure class="article-image full-width">
          <img src="/assets/img/content/caravan-dynamic-cog.jpg"
               alt="Diagram showing how gradients change tow ball weight"
               class="diagram-img"
               loading="lazy">
          <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #666; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;">
            <strong>Fig 3. The Hill Effect:</strong> On a slope, the centre of gravity shifts relative to the wheels, reducing weight on the rear of the car.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          If you have “perfect” balance on flat ground (zero tow ball weight), gravity works against you on an incline.
          As seen in <strong>Figure 3</strong>, the vertical pull of gravity moves behind the tyre contact patch. This creates negative lift on the hitch.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> This upward force lifts the rear of your tow vehicle, and behaves like the dangerous rear-biased setup shown in Figure 2.</p>

        <p>This is why we need an <strong>8%–12%</strong> buffer: it helps keep the tow ball heavy enough, even on steep ascents, without placing the load so far forward that handling becomes unpredictable.</p>

        <h3>3. The “Pre-Flight” Walkaround</h3>
        <p>Treat your rig like an aircraft. Before you pull out of the driveway or leave a campsite, do a physical walkaround. Do not rely on memory.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hitch Locked?</strong> Visually check the coupling is locked onto the ball.</li>
          <li><strong>Chains Crossed?</strong> Safety chains should be crossed under the hitch to catch the drawbar if it detaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Lights:</strong> Check indicators and brake lights (use a reflection in a window or ask a spotter).</li>
          <li><strong>Handbrake:</strong> Ensure the trailer handbrake is fully released.</li>
          <li><strong>Jockey Wheel:</strong> Double-check it is swung up and locked tight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Speed vs. Stability</h3>
        <p>Just because the speed limit is 110km/h doesn’t mean you should tow at 110km/h. Most trailer sway incidents occur at higher speeds where aerodynamic drag creates turbulence.</p>

        <p><strong>The Sweet Spot:</strong> Many seasoned tourers stick to 90–100km/h. You save fuel, reduce mechanical stress, and give yourself a buffer to react if the lever effect kicks in.</p>

        <h3>5. Handling Trailer Sway</h3>
        <p>If your trailer starts to sway (snake) behind you, your natural instinct will be to slam on the brakes. <strong>Do not do this.</strong> Braking hard while the trailer is swinging can cause it to jackknife instantly.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Do not make sudden steering inputs.</li>
          <li><strong>Ease off the accelerator:</strong> Let the vehicle slow down naturally.</li>
          <li><strong>Use the trailer brakes:</strong> If you have an electric brake controller (like a Redarc), manually override it to apply <em>only</em> the trailer brakes. This pulls the trailer straight again, like pulling a piece of string taut.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Trailer sway is usually a <strong>weight and balance issue</strong>, not a driving issue.
          <a href="/calculator/" class="text-link">Check your weight distribution</a>
        </p>

        <h3>6. Overtaking: The Patience Game</h3>
        <p>You are now a “Long Vehicle.” Overtaking requires significantly more clear road than you think.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Momentum:</strong> You don’t have the acceleration to zip around a road train.</li>
          <li><strong>Suction:</strong> As you pass a large truck, air pressure changes can pull your trailer toward the truck. Keep a wide berth.</li>
          <li><strong>Downhill:</strong> Never overtake downhill. Gravity is already destabilising your rig; adding speed increases the risk of sway.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>The One Thing Every Safe Tower Does</h3>
          <p>
            Experienced towers don’t guess, they calculate.
            GVM, GCM, axle loads and tow ball download must all work together.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re towing a caravan, camper or trailer, especially with accessories or passengers, you owe it to yourself to check.
