                <p>Building a touring 4WD is an exercise in compromise. You want the bull bar, the winch, the drawer system, and the long-range tank, but your vehicle has a strict GVM (Gross Vehicle Mass) limit. </p>
    
                <p>Many owners make the mistake of buying all their accessories first, installing them, driving to a weighbridge, and then realizing they are illegal. This is an expensive mistake. The smarter, lower-cost approach is to run a "virtual weigh-in" first using our <a href="/calculator/">GVM Calculator</a>.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: The "Virtual" Weigh-In</h3>
                <p>Before you spend money on heavy steel rear bars or rooftop tents, you should model your vehicle setup digitally. Our <a href="/calculator/">calculator</a> allows you to input the weights of accessories you <em>plan</em> to buy.</p>
                <p>This allows you to play "what if" scenarios for free. What happens if you swap steel wheels for alloy? What if you choose a lighter fridge? You can optimize your setup from the comfort of your couch, ensuring you only buy gear that keeps you legal. It saves you from the heartbreak of installing a $3,000 accessory only to find you have to remove it to pass a roadworthy.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Get Your Baseline (The Empty Weigh)</h3>
                <p>Calculators are only as good as the data you feed them. While you can estimate your starting weight based on the manufacturer's brochure, the gold standard is to get one single weighbridge ticket before you start your build (or in your current "daily driver" state).</p>
                <p>Take your vehicle to a local public weighbridge with a full tank of fuel but no camping gear. This gives you your <strong>Real World Tare Weight</strong>.</p> 
                
                <p>Once you have this number, enter it into the <a href="/calculator/">calculator</a> as your starting point. Now, your virtual calculations will be accurate to the kilogram.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Validation (The Loaded Weigh)</h3>
                <p>Once you have planned your build using the calculator and installed your gear, the final step is validation. This is the "exam" to prove your homework was correct.</p>
                <p>Pack your vehicle for a trip—full water, food, passengers, and gear—and head to the weighbridge. Because you used the <a href="/calculator/">GVM Calculator</a> during the planning phase, this trip shouldn't be a stressful surprise. It is simply a confirmation.</p>
                <p>When validating on the bridge, ensure you capture:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Front Axle Weight:</strong> To ensure you haven't unloaded the steering too much.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rear Axle Weight:</strong> The most common failure point for tourers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Mass:</strong> To ensure you are under the GVM.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Method Saves You Money</h3>
                <p>Public weighbridges are cheap (usually $20-$40), but the costs add up if you have to go back and forth every time you add a new piece of gear. By using the <a href="/calculator/">calculator</a> for the heavy lifting, you minimize the number of weighbridge visits required.</p>
                <p>More importantly, it saves you the cost of <strong>remorse</strong>. There is nothing more expensive than buying gear you legally cannot carry. Using the calculator first is free; finding out you are overweight after the fact is not.</p>
